# Sky Above the Clouds - Digital Experience

This digital experience was created for the Paper Moon Artist Residency Final Show, drawing inspiration from Georgia O'Keeffe's masterpiece "Sky Above the Clouds IV" - her largest completed painting.

## About the Project

In building this digital experience, I aim to reimagine technology's role in our lives - shifting away from advertisement-driven attention addiction toward creating spaces for peace and contemplation. This interactive piece invites viewers to explore a gentler side of digital interaction, one that fosters appreciation and mindfulness.

In this interactive experience, I invite the viewer to revisit forgotten moments and past sights seen. As a form of digital gift giving, please feel free to leave a memory for the next viewer to discover.

Each shared memory becomes part of a collective experience, creating an evolving digital landscape of human recollections.
