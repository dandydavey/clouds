# Sky Above the Clouds - Digital Experience

This digital experience was created for the Paper Moon Artist Residency Final Show centered on Georgia O'Keeffe's "Sky Above the Clouds IV" - her largest completed painting.

## About the Project

"Sky Above the Clouds IV" was the largest painting completed by Georgia O'Keeffe. In building a digital experience around this piece, I hope to reimagine a world where technology isn't dominated by advertisements and attention addiction but instead centers on a sense of peace and appreciation.

In this interactive experience, I invite the viewer to revisit forgotten moments and past sights seen. As a form of digital gift giving, please feel free to leave a memory for the next viewer to discover.
